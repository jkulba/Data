## Common Patterns

All systemd-managed services in this project follow a consistent pattern:

- **Dedicated system user** – each service runs as its own user for security isolation.
- **Docker group membership** – the service user is added to the `docker` group.
- **User lingering** – `loginctl enable-linger` allows the service to run when the user is not logged in.
- **Persistent data** – data is stored under `$HOME/.local/share/<service>-data`.
- **Host networking** – containers use `--network host` for simplified local networking.
- **Restart policy** – containers use `--restart=unless-stopped`.

### Standard Management Commands

Every service management script supports the same commands:

```bash
./service-name.sh start    # Remove existing container and start a new one
./service-name.sh stop     # Stop and remove the container
./service-name.sh status   # Show container status (docker ps -a)
./service-name.sh health   # Run service-specific health checks
```

### Standard systemd Commands

```bash
sudo systemctl start   <service>.service   # Start the service
sudo systemctl stop    <service>.service   # Stop the service
sudo systemctl status  <service>.service   # Check service status
sudo systemctl enable  <service>.service   # Enable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl disable <service>.service   # Disable auto-start on boot
sudo journalctl -xeu   <service>.service   # View service logs
sudo journalctl -fu    <service>.service   # Follow real-time logs
```

## Prerequisites

All services require:

- Linux system with **systemd**
- **Docker** and Docker CLI installed ([setup guide](Docker-WSL2-Setup))
- **Root / sudo** access for service installation
